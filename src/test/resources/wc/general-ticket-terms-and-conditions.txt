1.Acceptance of GTCs by the Ticket Holder
Any use of 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil™ (“Competition”) match tickets (in the form of a paper ticket or other device) (“Tickets”) and the terms of admission to the Stadium at which a specific Competition match (“Match”) is taking place will be subject to the following General Terms and Conditions (“GTCs”) as established by FIFA Ticketing AG and/or 2014 FIFA World Cup Venda de Ingressos Ltda. (together with Fédération Internationale de Football Association jointly referred to as “FIFA”).
Anyone who purchases, holds or uses a Ticket (“Ticket Holder”) will have, or will be deemed to have, fully and irrevocably agreed with FIFA to these GTCs.


2. Confirmation of GTCs and Stadium Code of Conduct
In addition to Section 1, by completion and submission to FIFA of an online or hard copy application or order form for Tickets (“Ticket Application Form”) each person who applies for and purchases Tickets (“Ticket Applicant”) confirms that:
 (a) he/she has read, understood and accepted the GTCs and applicable safety, security and other rules of conduct adopted by FIFA in the stadium code of conduct, which are published and available from the sources identified in Clauses 11.2 and 11.3 below (“Stadium Code of Conduct”), and
 (b) he/she undertakes that each individual receiving a Ticket through the Ticket Applicant (directly or indirectly) will have read, understood and accepted these GTCs and the Stadium Code of Conduct prior to receiving a Ticket (in addition to the fact that any Ticket Holder will also be deemed to have fully and irrevocably agreed with FIFA to these GTCs and the Stadium Code of Conduct as per Section 1 above). For that purpose, the Ticket Applicant will provide a copy of these GTCs and the Stadium Code of Conduct to the individuals receiving Tickets from him/her or will direct the individuals to the additional sources for copies of these GTCs and the Stadium Code of Conduct that are identified in Clauses 11.2 and 11.3 below.


3. Entry to the Stadium and Stadium Conduct

3.1Entry into a stadium, which includes specifically indicated areas of the stadium being under the control of the FIFA World Cup™ Authorities (as defined in clause 3.2 below) on a Match day (“Stadium”), will be authorised on a Match day during the official opening hours as determined by FIFA and only upon the presentation of a valid Ticket by each person seeking to gain entrance, regardless of his/her age.  The Ticket Holder must retain his/her Ticket during the Match for verification purposes.

3.2 Each Ticket is official evidence authorized by FIFA to indicate a personal, revocable license to enter and stay in the Stadium on a Match day during the opening hours of the Stadium as determined by FIFA subject to the terms and conditions set forth under these GTCs and applicable laws.  This means that a Ticket shows permission from FIFA to enter and remain in the Stadium subject to the conditions identified in these GTCs, in particular in this Clause 3. FIFA remains the owner of the Ticket. All Ticket Holders must comply with:
(a) the GTCs,
(b) the sales regulations applicable to the Ticket Applicant outlined in the Ticket Application Form, which is available through the sources identified in Clauses 11.2 and 11.3 below (the “Ticket Sales Regulations”),

3.3 A Ticket, and consequently the license to enter and stay in a Stadium, will be automatically revoked in case of a violation of any terms of the GTCs, the Stadium Code of Conduct, the Ticket Sales Regulations and/or any of the relevant laws, by-laws, regulations, ordinances of, or instructions given by, the FIFA World Cup™ Authorities.  Examples of prohibited conduct include: to be noticeably under the influence of alcohol, narcotics or any behaviour-modifying substance; to express any offensive messages, of racist nature, xenophobic nature, or which stimulate other forms of discrimination; to promote any political, ideological messages or any charitable cause; to hinder or harass other individuals, including players and Match officials; to behave, or to show a tendency to behave violently, harmfully or in a manner likely to disrupt public order.
Examples of items prohibited in the Stadium include: weapons of any kind or anything that could be used as a weapon, fireworks, flares or other pyrotechnics, commercial materials or similar items which could infringe any rights of FIFA for the Competition, and other objects which could compromise public safety and/or harm the reputation of the Competition.
Examples of instructions that may be given by the FIFA World Cup™ Authorities include: an instruction by which a Ticket Holder is requested to leave the stadium, move to a different seat for safety and security reasons, due to technical requirements or to ensure the orderly and smooth implementation of the Competition, and to cover or to remove any materials displaying commercial or otherwise prohibited content.

3.4 The FIFA World Cup™ Authorities may give instructions on the basis of these GTCs, the Sales Regulations and the Stadium Code of Conduct. The FIFA World Cup™ Authorities will be entitled to carry out checks on any Ticket Holder. Each Ticket Holder is required to cooperate with the FIFA World Cup™ Authorities. The Ticket Holder must provide proof of his/her identity, including photographic identification, upon request, and must consent to the confiscation of items prohibited in the Stadium that may be in his/her possession.

3.5 Individuals who have been banned from attending football matches by competent authorities or sports governing bodies in any country, or who are considered as a security risk, are prohibited from receiving Tickets and from entering or remaining in the Stadium.

3.6 Ticket Holders leaving the Stadium will not be re-admitted unless otherwise approved by the FIFA World Cup™ Authorities. The FIFA World Cup™ Authorities will not replace any Tickets, irrespective of the reason for the replacement request, such as lost or stolen Tickets.

3.7 Each Ticket is personalised with the identification of the Ticket Applicant and numbered to identify a specific seat. Each Ticket Holder must sit in the seat allocated to the respective Ticket. However, the FIFA World Cup™ Authorities reserve the right to substitute the seat identified on the Ticket with another seat, if appropriate for security or technical reasons, even if the seat is in a different block but at least of the equivalent category. THE TICKET HOLDER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT SUCH SUBSTITUTION DOES NOT CHANGE THE VALUE OF THE SEAT AND THE SERVICES WHICH A TICKET HOLDER IS ENTITLED TO RECEIVE WITH THE TICKET AND DOES NOT ENTITLE ANY OF THE TICKET HOLDERS TO ANY REFUND OR FURTHER COMPENSATION

3.8 Any Ticket Holder entering the Stadium accompanied by children or adolescents must obtain, carry and present at any time, upon request of the FIFA World Cup™ Authorities, the necessary authorization from the minor parents or legal guardians, as established by the local regulations.

3.9 The FIFA World Cup™ Authorities cannot guarantee:
(a) that a specific player or team will participate in the Match;
(b) the duration of the Match; and
(c) THAT THE TICKET HOLDER WILL HAVE ENTIRELY UNINTERRUPTED AND/OR UNINHIBITED VIEW OF THE MATCH FROM THE SEAT PROVIDED.
THE TICKET HOLDER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT ANY OF THE ABOVE DOES NOT CHANGE THE VALUE OF THE SEAT AND/OR THE SERVICES WHICH A TICKET HOLDER IS ENTITLED TO RECEIVE WITH THE TICKET AND DOES NOT ENTITLE ANY OF THE TICKET HOLDERS TO ANY REFUND OR FURTHER COMPENSATION.

3.10 DUE TO APPLICABLE LAWS IN BRAZIL, THE PURCHASE OR USE OF CERTAIN TICKETS BY RESIDENTS OF BRAZIL IS SUBJECT TO A PERSONAL CONDITION DEFINED BY LAW (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO AGE OR RESIDENCE) (THE “PERSONAL CONDITION”). THESE PERSONAL CONDITIONS DO NOT APPLY TO INDIVIDUALS NOT BEING A RESIDENT OF BRAZIL.
IF THE PURCHASE OR USE OF A TICKET IS SUBJECT TO A PERSONAL CONDITION OR A PERSONAL DISABILITY, IN ADDITION TO PROOF OF HIS/HER IDENTITY, THE TICKET HOLDER MUST CARRY AND PRESENT AT ANY TIME, UPON REQUEST OF THE FIFA WORLD CUPTM AUTHORITIES, THE REQUIRED OFFICIAL BRAZILIAN DOCUMENTS WHICH EVIDENCE HIS/HER FULFILMENT OF THE PERSONAL CONDITION OR PERSONAL DISABILITY REQUIRED FOR THE PURCHASE OR USE OF THE TICKET.
THIS MEANS THAT, REGARDLESS OF THE PROVISION IN ITEM 3.2, A TICKET WHICH IS SUBJECT TO A PERSONAL CONDITION OR A PERSONAL DISABILITY DOES NOT GRANT BY ITSELF (WITHOUT THE PRESENTATION OF THE REQUIRED OFFICIAL BRAZILIAN DOCUMENTS), PERMISSION FROM FIFA TO ENTER AND REMAIN IN THE STADIUM.

7. Acceptance of Risk and Limited Liability

7.1 Each Ticket Holder is responsible for behaving at the Stadium in a way which safeguards his/her own personal safety and the safety of any minors or other persons without legal capacity (“Incapable Individual”)  using a Ticket purchased by  The Ticket Holder, in his/her own name and on behalf of any Incapable Individual, and accepts all risks and dangers which the Ticket Holder or any such Incapable Individual may face or endure while attending the Match and waives any claims against the FIFA World Cup™ Authorities relating to such risks and dangers.

10. Unforeseen Circumstances

10.1 The Ticket Holder acknowledges that FIFA and/or the referee of the Match are entitled but not obliged to entirely or partially cancel, or interrupt, or replay, the Match, or change the time, date and/or the place of the Competition Match, as a result of a Force Majeure event or other applicable reasons.
“Force Majeure” events include storm, heavy rain, earthquake, flood or other acts of God, war, invasion, act of foreign enemy, hostilities (whether war be declared or not), civil war or strife, riot, national state of emergency, scourge or other declared public health emergency, fire, explosion, act of terrorism, rebellion, theft of essential equipment, malicious damage, strikes, lock-outs or other industrial disputes, air or ground transportation traffic or route closures, third party injunctions, acts of governments or other prevailing authorities, or any other similar or related event which is beyond the control of FIFA or another FIFA World Cup™ Authority.
Other applicable reasons include, for example, the protection of the integrity of the Competition or decisions based on the Laws of the Game, which are the codified rules of the sport of association football as authorised by the International Football Association Board.

10.2 If the Match is cancelled, the Ticket shall be rendered invalid and the Ticket Holder shall be entitled to a refund.
If FIFA makes a change to the time or date of the Match, the Ticket will be valid for the re-scheduled Match.

If a Match is relocated to another venue, FIFA may decide that the Ticket will be valid for the relocated Match or to provide a refund to the Ticket Holder.
If a Match is replayed, the replay match is considered a new match and the Ticket will not be valid for the new match and the Ticket Holder shall not be entitled to a refund or any further compensation.

10.3 Should the Ticket Holder be entitled to a refund pursuant to Section 10.2, such refund shall be limited to the price paid to FIFA for the Ticket.
