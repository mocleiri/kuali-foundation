# If you change this script it will not take affect on newly spun up EC2 instances until:
# 1 - You publish and release another version of kuali-ec2
# 2 - You update the top level kuali-pom so it contains a reference to the new version
# 3 - You publish and release another version of the kuali pom
# 4 - You make the kuali-example project point to the new version of the kuali pom
#
#
# If you only change what the following commands do behind the scenes,
# ie you add/update/remove plugin executions or alter the Ant scripting,
# no further action is required.  The changes will be automatically
# picked up and executed the next time an environment is spun up
