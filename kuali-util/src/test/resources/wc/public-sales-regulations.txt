1. Purpose of these Ticket Sales Regulations

1.1 These Ticket Sales Regulations shall apply to, and govern, the sales of tickets by FIFA (“Tickets”) to individuals (i) not being a resident of Brazil and (ii) not purchasing a Ticket in a FIFA Venue Ticketing Centre in Brazil (as defined in section 11.1 below) for match(es) (“Matches”) of the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil™ (“Competition”) that may be made available by FIFA Ticketing AG, a subsidiary of Fédération Internationale de Football Association (collectively, “FIFA”).

1.2 The number of Tickets made available for sale to the general public will be determined by FIFA for each Match. Due to temporary media facilities, Ticket allocations reserved by FIFA for customer groups other than the general public, as well as further security or other organisational needs, which may all vary for each Match, the number of Tickets will vary from Match to Match and will never be equivalent to the total number of seats in the stadium in which a Match takes place (“Stadium”). During the Competition on any given Match day, the Stadium is under the control of FIFA, the local organizing committee for the 2014 FIFA World Cup™ (Copa do Mundo da FIFA 2014 – Comitê Organizador Brasileiro Ltda.) (“LOC”), the FIFA Ticketing Centre (“FTC”) and the FIFA Ticketing Office (“FTO”), which are trading names for FIFA´s service provider MATCH Services AG and its Brazilian subsidiary MATCH Serviços de Eventos Ltda., or the Stadium management and/or the Brazilian public authority(ies) responsible for safety and security in connection with the Matches, and their respective employees, volunteers, agents, representatives, officers and directors (all together “FIFA World Cup Authorities™”).

1.3 The sale of Tickets  by 2014 FIFA World Cup Venda de Ingressos Ltda(i) to individuals being a resident of Brazil or purchasing a Ticket in a FIFA Venue Ticketing Centre within Brazil (as defined in section 11.1 below) or (ii) to customer groups other than the general public or (iii) that are part of a ticketing product containing other benefits, products and/or services in addition to the Tickets, such as, but not limited to, parking and/or catering services will be governed by specific sales regulations applicable for these forms of sale of Tickets.

1.4. A TICKET MUST BE PURCHASED FOR EACH PERSON WHO WISHES TO ATTEND A MATCH, REGARDLESS OF AGE.


2. Ticket Application Form

2.1 The Ticket application form made available by FIFA, the FTC or any other third party authorised by FIFA, is the only means through which an individual may request to purchase a specified number and category of Tickets for Matches in accordance with its terms and conditions, including, without limitation, these Ticket Sales Regulations (“Ticket Application Form”).

2.2 The individual completing and submitting the Ticket Application Form (“Ticket Applicant”) will be solely responsible for the accurate content of the Ticket Application Form and its submission in a timely, complete, undamaged and unchanged form pursuant to these Ticket Sales Regulations and the Ticket Application Form. Inaccurate, late, incomplete, changed or damaged Ticket Application Forms will be rejected by FIFA. Additional notes, requests, attachments, appeals, changes or further alterations to the standard offer by the Ticket Applicant which may be contained in, or attached to, the completed Ticket Application Form will not be considered or accepted by FIFA. Any acceptance by FIFA is based on the assumption that all information provided by the Ticket Applicant is accurate and correct. In the event that, subsequent to FIFA’s partial or full acceptance of the Ticket Applicant’s offer, FIFA detects in the content provided by the Ticket Applicant any inaccuracy or deviation from the standard offer, such acceptance shall not be deemed nor construed as FIFA’s acceptance of such inaccuracy or deviation from the standard offer and FIFA may, fully or partially, cancel, at its sole discretion, the Tickets allocated to the Ticket Applicant and terminate the Ticket Sales Agreement,  pursuant to the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil™ General Terms and Conditions for the Use of Tickets (“GTCs”) and these Ticket Sales Regulations.


3. Selection of Ticket Categories

3.1 Under these Ticketing Sales Regulations, FIFA sells Tickets for all Matches to the general public in four (4) different price categories, defined as Ticket category 1 to 4 (“Ticket Category”), with Ticket Category 1 representing the highest price category and Ticket Category 4 the lowest price category. All Tickets in Ticket Category 4 (“Category 4 Tickets”) will be sold exclusively to, and must be used by, individuals resident in Brazil. The assignment of Stadium seats to one of the four Ticket Categories will be done by FIFA on a Match-by-Match-basis for each Stadium individually in accordance with international standards as indicated in the Ticket Application Form.
FIFA DETERMINES THE CATEGORISATION OF EACH SEAT IN THE STADIUM ON A MATCH-BY-MATCH BASIS. THE TICKET APPLICANT ACKNOWLEDGES THAT
THE TICKET CATEGORY TO WHICH A SPECIFIC STADIUM SEAT IS ASSIGNED MAY VARY FROM MATCH TO MATCH;
ALL TICKET CATEGORIES, INCLUDING TICKET CATEGORY 1 MAY COMPRISE STADIUM SEATS OF THE LOWER AND UPPER TIER OF THE STADIUM;
THE TICKET CATEGORISATION REMAINS UNAFFECTED FROM ANY CONDITIONS ON THE MATCH DAY, WHICH MAY HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE USE OF THE SEATS, SUCH AS WEATHER CONDITIONS; AND
TICKET CATEGORY BOUNDARIES MAY VARY FROM MATCH TO MATCH.
SUCH DIFFERENTATION IS NECESSARY TO SECURE THAT THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF TICKETS CAN BE MADE AVAILABLE TO FOOTBALL FANS AND AT THE SAME TIME THE GLOBAL MEDIA AND FURTHER STAKEHOLDERS ARE SERVICED.
The Ticket Applicant must indicate in the Ticket Application Form the Ticket Category requested for each Match. The Ticket Applicant may only apply for one (1) Ticket Category per Match unless permitted under section 3.2 below.

3.2 If the Ticket Applicant has duly indicated his consent in the Ticket Application Form to be allocated Tickets in a lower Ticket Category than that Ticket Category specified as his/her first choice, the Ticket Application Form completed and submitted for his/her first choice shall be deemed to implicitly contain the Ticket Applicant’s offer to purchase Tickets in such lower Ticket Category (subject to availability and the sales restrictions on Category 4 Tickets).


4. Sales Restrictions

4.1 THE TICKET APPLICANT CAN ONLY APPLY FOR A MAXIMUM OF FOUR (4) SINGLE TICKETS FOR UP TO SEVEN (7) MATCHES PER HOUSEHOLD (I.E. A TOTAL OF 28 TICKETS) AND ONLY FOR ONE SINGLE MATCH ON ANY GIVEN MATCH DAY. THE TICKET APPLICANT CAN ONLY APPLY FOR CATEGORY 4 TICKETS IF THE TICKET APPLICANT IS RESIDENT IN BRAZIL AND FOR GUESTS WHICH ARE RESIDENT IN BRAZIL.

4.2 ALL TICKET APPLICATION FORMS RECEIVED FROM A TICKET APPPLICANT WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY REJECTED BY FIFA IF THE TICKET APPLICANT
APPLIES FOR MORE TICKETS OR MORE TICKET CATEGORIES THAN PERMITTED PER MATCH OR FOR MORE MATCHES THAN PERMITTED PURSUANT TO THESE SALES REGULATIONS;
APPLIES FOR MORE THAN ONE SINGLE MATCH ON THE SAME MATCH DAY;  
APPLIES FOR A CATEGORY 4 TICKET BUT IS NOT RESIDENT IN BRAZIL;
SUBMITS MULTIPLE TICKET APPLICATIONS FOR THE SAME MATCH; OR
BY ANY MEANS CIRCUMVENTS THE SALES RESTRICTIONS ESTABLISHED HEREIN, INCLUDING BY USING THE SAME PAYMENT CARD IN DIFFERENT TICKET APPLICATIONS.

4.3 THE SALES RESTRICTIONS SET FORTH IN SECTIONS 4.1 and 4.2 ABOVE SHALL APPLY TO ALL PERSONS IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER A PERSON APPLIES HIMSELF/HERSELF AS TICKET APPLICANT OR IS NAMED AS GUEST IN OTHER TICKET APPLICATION FORMS. THEREFORE A TICKET APPLICATION SHALL BE AUTOMATICALLY REJECTED FOR THE PERSON IN VIOLATION OF ANY OF THESE SALES RESTRICTIONS AS TICKET APPLICANT AND/OR GUEST.

4.4 Any acceptance by FIFA is based on the assumption that the Ticket Applicant has observed all sales restrictions set forth in this section 4. In the event that, subsequent to FIFA’s partial or full acceptance of the Ticket Applicant’s offer, FIFA detects any violation of the sales restrictions, such acceptance shall not be deemed or construed as FIFA’s acceptance of such violation of the sales restrictions and FIFA may, fully or partially, cancel, at its sole discretion the Tickets allocated to the Ticket Applicant and terminate the Ticket Sales Agreement pursuant to the GTCs and these Ticket Sales Regulations.


5. Availability of Tickets 

5.1 Tickets will be made available in different sales phases as described in the Ticket Application Form and further Ticket sales materials which FIFA may publish from time to time. FIFA’s ability to satisfy a request for Tickets as specified by the Ticket Applicant in the Ticket Application Form depends on the total number of Tickets requested from Ticket Applicants and, with respect to certain sales phases, the results of the random selection draws for oversubscribed Matches. Tickets are only available within the available Ticket allocations. FIFA may release additional Tickets from reserved allocations for sale to the general public and other customer groups from time to time. 


6. Ticket Purchase Offer

6.1 The Ticket Applicant is solely responsible for the accuracy of the content provided by the Ticket Applicant in the Ticket Application Form. Completion and submission of the Ticket Application Form to FIFA, the FTC or any other third party authorised by FIFA constitutes an irrevocable and binding offer to FIFA by the Ticket Applicant to purchase the Tickets identified in the Ticket Application Form. However, the Ticket Applicant´s offer for a certain quantity of Tickets for a Match shall be deemed to implicitly contain the Ticket Applicant’s offer to purchase the same, or a lower, number of Tickets for the same Match or for a lower number of Matches.

6.2 The Ticket Applicant must be of legal age to submit to FIFA a binding offer for the purchase of a Ticket.

6.3 THE TICKET APPLICATION FORM MAY BE CHANGED OR CANCELLED BY THE TICKET APPLICANT AFTER SUBMISSION UNTIL SUCH DATES AS INDICATED IN THE TICKET APPLICATION FORM BUT IN ANY CASE NO LATER THAN PROVISION OF THE TICKET CONFIRMATION TO THE TICKET APPLICANT AS DEFINED BELOW. 

6.4 NEITHER COMPLETION NOR SUBMISSION OF THE TICKET APPLICATION FORM BY THE TICKET APPLICANT, NOR FIFA’S ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF RECEIPT OF THE TICKET APPLICATION FORM GUARANTEES THE AVAILABILITY OF TICKETS FOR THE TICKET APPLICANT, OR CONSTITUTES THE CONCLUSION OF THE SALE OF TICKETS. IN ORDER TO BE SUCCESSFUL A TICKET APPLICATION FORM MUST BE PROCESSED BY FIFA PURSUANT TO SECTION 7 BELOW.


7. Acceptance by FIFA

7.1 If Tickets are available and FIFA partially or fully satisfies the request stipulated in the Ticket Application Form by allocating Tickets to the Ticket Applicant, the Ticket Applicant will be provided with a confirmation of the transaction by e-mail, post, SMS, fax, personal delivery or otherwise (“Ticket Confirmation”). The Ticket Confirmation will specify the quantity of Tickets allocated to the Ticket Applicant, the Ticket Category, the venue and the Match (i.e. the number of the Match according to the Match schedule comprised in the Ticket Application Form, but not necessarily the specification of the participating teams). THE TICKET CONFIRMATION WILL NOT IDENTIFY SPECIFIC SEAT NUMBERS, WHICH WILL ONLY BE ASSIGNED IN A LATER STAGE, PURSUANT TO SECTION 10 BELOW. The issuance or remittance of the Ticket Confirmation represents FIFA’s partial or full acceptance of the Ticket Applicant’s offer and constitutes the conclusion of the agreement for the sale of Tickets (“Ticket Sales Agreement”). FIFA may notify unsuccessful Ticket Applicants, without being required to provide any reasons for the rejection of a Ticket application.

7.2 All Ticket sales are final. Anyone who purchases, holds or uses a Ticket (“Ticket Holder”) cannot elect to cancel a purchase or return Tickets after conclusion of the sale, provided however, that: (i) certain third party transfers by a successful Ticket Applicant may be permitted in limited circumstances pursuant to FIFA’s Ticket transfer policy, which will be defined by FIFA and made available on www.fifa.com/tickets  and (ii) special rules may be applicable with respect to Team Series Tickets (“TSTs”) as described in the Ticket Application Form; FIFA may cancel the Ticket and terminate the Ticket Sales Agreement, fully or partially, pursuant to the GTCs and these Ticket Sales Regulations.
EXCEPT FOR THE SPECIAL CASES SET FORTH ABOVE IN THIS SECTION 7.2, THE TICKET APPLICANT IS NOT ENTITLED TO CANCEL A PURCHASE OR TERMINATE THE TICKET SALES AGREEMENT OR RETURN TICKETS AFTER CONCLUSION OF THE SALE.


8. Price; Taxes; Fees; Currency; Delivery Fees 

8.1 The price for Tickets is determined by FIFA and will be set out in the Ticket Application Form. Ticket prices will depend on (i) the Ticket Category, and (ii) the stage of the Competition (i.e. group stage, round of 16, quarter-finals, semi-finals, third place Match and final). In addition, the price of Tickets for the opening Match is higher than the price of Tickets for the other group stage Matches. The prices determined by FIFA for the Ticket Categories depending on the stage of the Competition shall remain the same throughout all sales phases. All prices include all applicable taxes and exclude any delivery fees as set forth in Clause 8.4. 

8.2 Due to the high level of administration connected with TSTs, in addition to the price printed on the face of each Ticket, an additional TST fee will be due for all TSTs, as set forth in the Ticket Application Form. In case a TST purchase is cancelled by FIFA due to the non-qualification of the relevant team, FIFA will refund the payment made by the Ticket Applicant less US Dollars 10.00 (ten United States Dollars).    

8.3 The price printed on the face of each Ticket sold by 2014 FIFA World Cup Venda de Ingressos Ltda, in Brazil is fixed in Brazilian Reais and the price printed on the face of each Ticket sold by FIFA Ticketing AG is fixed in US Dollars, and such face prices shall not be changed throughout the sales process, regardless of currency exchange fluctuation.

8.4 In case a Ticket Applicant requests that the allocated Tickets shall be delivered by courier to the Ticket Applicant as set forth in Clause 11.1, the Ticket Applicant will be solely responsible for any delivery fees associated with such delivery. The amount of the delivery fees will depend on the address to which the Tickets shall be delivered. The delivery fee will be payable in addition to the Ticket price payable by the Ticket Applicant and will be charged from the Ticket Applicant in the same currency as the Ticket price.

8.5 In any and all Ticket transactions in other currencies, which need to be converted into US Dollars, currency exchanges will be determined by the Ticket Applicant’s payment card company during the billing process. Further information on applicable currency exchange rates may be obtained from the Ticket Applicants’ payment card company.  In case of wire transfers, the currency exchange rate will be based upon the exchange rate offered by the bank where the Ticket Applicant requests the wire transfer, as determined on the date that the wire transfer is requested by the Ticket Applicant.


9. Payment Process

9.1 FIFA will accept such means of payment as indicated in the Ticket Application Form.

9.2 If the Ticket Applicant choses to pay by payment card, the nominated payment card to purchase Tickets must be registered in the name of the Ticket Applicant. Any Ticket Application Form nominating a payment card not registered in the name of the Ticket Applicant shall be rejected by FIFA. Any acceptance by FIFA is based on the assumption that the payment card used is registered in the name of the Ticket Applicant.  In the event that, subsequent to FIFA’s partial or full acceptance of the Ticket Applicant’s offer, FIFA detects the use of a payment card not registered in the name of the Ticket Applicant, such acceptance shall not be deemed or construed as FIFA’s acceptance of such violation of these Ticket Sales Regulations and FIFA shall, fully or partially, cancel the Tickets allocated to the Ticket Applicant and terminate the Ticket Sales Agreement, pursuant to the GTCs and these Ticket Sales Regulations.
The Ticket Applicant must ensure that his nominated payment card is valid for the duration of the applicable Ticket sales phase, that all required information is provided and confirmed, and there is sufficient credit for the transaction requested.  In case of a successful Ticket application, FIFA will charge the nominated payment card prior to issuance or remittance of the Ticket Confirmation and without any specific notification being required. If FIFA is not able to charge the nominated payment card, the Ticket application will be automatically rejected.

9.4 FULL AND TIMELY PAYMENT OF ALL TICKETS AND THE DELIVERY FEE (IF APPLICABLE) IS OF ESSENCE AND A MATERIAL OBLIGATION OF THE TICKET APPLICANT. If FIFA only receives partial payment from the Ticket Applicant, or the payment is not received on time, the Ticket Application may be rejected by FIFA in its entirety. Any acceptance by FIFA is based on the assumption that payment was received in a timely and full manner.  In the event that, subsequent to FIFA’s partial or full acceptance of the Ticket Applicant’s offer, FIFA detects partial or delayed payment, such acceptance shall not be deemed or construed as FIFA’s acceptance of such violation of these Ticket Sales Regulations and FIFA shall, fully or partially, cancel the allocated Tickets and terminate the Ticket Sales Agreement, pursuant to the GTCs and these Ticket Sales Regulations.
Any and all bank or other charges incurred as a result of the payment with a payment card or currency conversion will be the sole responsibility of the Ticket Applicant.

9.5 Due to the nature and operational structure of the sale of Tickets of the Competition simultaneously on a worldwide basis in separate sales phases, in particular the time constraints related thereto and to secure that the maximum number of Tickets can be made available to football fans, TIMELY AND DUE PAYMENT TO FIFA IS OF ESSENCE AND A MATERIAL OBLIGATION OF THE TICKET APPLICANT and
FIFA will reject payment by the Ticket Applicant if such payment is made after the payment dates set forth in section 9.2 above or informed by FIFA in the Ticket Application Form or through any other means of disclosure; and
no additional period of time to cure the full or partial non-payment will be granted to the Ticket Applicant by FIFA.


10. Seating

10.1 FIFA will assign a specific seat to each Ticket. FIFA will endeavour, but cannot guarantee, that all seats assigned to Tickets for a Match which are allocated to a successful Ticket Applicant will be located adjacent to one another. Seats assigned to a Ticket Applicant may be located in different sections, rows or blocks of seats.  FIFA cannot provide adjacent seats to persons submitting separate Ticket Application Forms. 

10.2 THE TICKET APPLICANT ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE SPECIFIC LOCATION OF A SEAT WITHIN A TICKET CATEGORY DOES NOT CHANGE THE PRICE OF THE TICKET AND THAT SEATS WITHIN A CATEGORY CAN HAVE DIFFERENT CHARACTERISTICS AND THAT A SEAT MAY BE LOCATED ADJACENT TO THE BOUNDARIES OF A STADIUM SECTOR OR A SEAT OF ANOTHER TICKET CATEGORY.

11. Collection or Delivery of Tickets

11.1 Tickets allocated by FIFA to the Ticket Applicant will be made available for collection by the Ticket Applicant at the ticketing centres operated by FIFA in all venues of the Competition prior and during the Competition (“FIFA Venue Ticketing Centres”) at such time and place as described in the Ticket Application Form or at www.fifa.com/tickets.
The Ticket Applicant will be offered the option to request delivery of the allocated Tickets by courier to the Ticket Applicants address, at the Ticket Applicant’s own costs. Delivery of Tickets will not be possible for:

Tickets purchased in the last minute sales phase;
TST Tickets which include any of the round of 16 matches, quarter-finals matches, semi-final matches and the final match; and

The details of the Ticket delivery are described at www.fifa.com/tickets.
The Ticket Applicant acknowledges that in order to ensure the highest possible level of security; FIFA WILL NOT MAKE AVAILABLE TICKETS FOR COLLECTION AT THE STADIUM ON MATCH DAYS. All Tickets comprised in a successful Ticket Application must be personally collected by the Ticket Applicant or by a legal representative holding a power of attorney specific for these purposes. Proper identification with embedded photo and/or the payment card used in the transaction must be presented at the FIFA Venue Ticketing Centres as specified in the Ticket Application Form. IN CASE THE TICKET APPLICANT WISHES THE TICKETS TO BE COLLECTED BY A THIRD PARTY, SUCH THIRD MUST BE DULY AUTHORIZED BY THE TICKET APPLICANT BY MEANS OF A NOTARIZED POWER OF ATTORNEY AND NOTARIZED COPIES OF BOTH THE TICKET APPLICANT’S AND THE ATTORNEY’S IDENTIFICATION DOCUMENTS WITH EMBEDDED PHOTOGRAPHS. The locations of the FIFA Venue Ticketing Centres will be made available at www.fifa.com and further Ticket sales materials which FIFA may choose to publish. TICKETS MAY ONLY BE COLLECTED AFTER RECEIPT OF FULL PAYMENT BY FIFA.
