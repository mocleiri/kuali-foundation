DEVOPS-20
 - symbolic links appear to get nuked by untar then rezip
 - should be fine, just a little less compact because you end up with duplicate copies of the items that were symbolically linked
 - Run new Ant script on jdk7 21, md5 against already published jdk21
 - Use Ant tar targets if possible
 - jre/lib/amd64/server/libjsig.so -> ../libjsig.so
 
DEVOPS-21
 - binaries with no checksums
 - expand to all repos
 - war, zip
 



- no checksum verification on the zip file, but diff -r -q on the exploded directory structure showed no differences 
- upload zip files manually into Kuali Nexus Hosted Private
- make sure the resulting zip files are formatted the same way as the examples that are already up there
