Monday
------
- Continued work on bringing up the new CI
- split the installjenkins script into 2 scripts
-- installjenkins and configurejenkins
-- installjenkins just creates and verifies a vanilla Jenkins instance with a set of plugins (no Kuali specific config)
-- configurejenkins updates the vanilla jenkins with Kuali specific config (secret keys, security settings, jobs, config history, etc)
-- documented improved method for obtaining Oracle JDK's
-- coordinated with Martin on CI related tasks, bringing jobs from ci.rice.kuali.org over to ci.kuali.org
