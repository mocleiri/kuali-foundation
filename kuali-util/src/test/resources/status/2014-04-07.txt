Monday
------
- Continued work on bringing up the new CI
- split the installjenkins script into 2 scripts
-- installjenkins and configurejenkins
-- installjenkins just creates and verifies a vanilla Jenkins instance with a set of plugins (no Kuali specific config)
-- configurejenkins updates the vanilla jenkins with Kuali specific config (secret keys, security settings, jobs, config history, etc)
-- documented improved method for obtaining Oracle JDK's
-- coordinated with Martin on CI related tasks, bringing jobs from ci.rice.kuali.org over to ci.kuali.org

- responded to Peri related to an OLE JIRA about UTF-8

- created automated routine to post M2 repository cache to S3 on demand
- reconfigured the tomcat7 user so it has sudo privileges without requiring a password
- responded to email from Amazon claiming that the Rice secret key is publicly available in Mike O'Cleirigh's github account
-- the secret key is encrypted, it's not publicly available

Tuesday
-------
- Continued work on bringing up the new CI
-- tested that a KS deploy works correctly 
-- confirms SSH keys are setup correctly + a bunch of other things

-- emailed and texted Lue Ann from Amazon related to the bogus email, waiting to hear back

- OLE MySQL utf8 vs utf8mb4
-- analyzed maven-impex-plugin
-- analyzed velocity templates
-- batted around potential ideas/solutions/etc for making the character set and collation configurable via a property
- Skype conversation with Giles related to utf8mb4 and Rice

- combined Kuali call (OLE, KS, Rice, OLE, KPME)
- weekly meeting with Jessica

- consulting/empathizing with KC on some craziness Travis found with a BIRT library they depend on
-- BIRT physically embeds a handful of other OSS projects inside of its own jar
-- this causes ridiculous, non-deterministic issues at runtime since there are now 2 different versions of the same class on the classpath
-- provided assurance that DevOps can very quickly/easily publish an updated jar file both to Maven Central and internally
-- where the source code lives eg Subversion / GitHub is irrelevant to that process 

-- left several detailed code reviews on the fusion-maven-plugin KS is developing highlighting a few ways to simplify/improve things

-- assisted Farooq with a spreadsheet related to billing for shared cloud services

-- Simulated disaster recovery by auto-migrating Kuali's new CI service back and forth between all 3 US regions (us-east-1, us-west-1, us-west-2)
-- Takes ~17 minutes to fully migrate the service to another region complete with all jobs and build history

Wednesday
---------

- 25% of the day (2 hours) spent in meetings 
-- 1 hour for the KTI
-- 1 hour for the ARC/TRC

- OpenSSL / Heartbleed
-- Setup new root access keys for all 4 AWS accounts under my purview
-- Tasked Mike with setting up an IAM account with administrator privileges on all 4 accounts
-- Analyzed existing IAM accounts with an eye towards removing/disabling any accounts that are not associated with an actively engaged person on that project
-- Sought feedback from infrastructure on the IAM accounts spreadsheet

- Simplified the encryption API in kuali-util 
-- Needs to be easier to use and available at a lower level in the stack
-- needs to be available outside of a Spring application 
-- needs to be useful as a command line utility
-- Deprecated the old encryption API in favor of the new API

Thursday
--------

- Pointed Eric W at the logs for demo.rice for Accunet troubleshooting
- Corrected mis-perception that the engine behind the environments page is a lame ass PHP application (it's not only pure java all it needs is a GUI and it can be a real time application) 
- Met with Larry on KS version numbering scheme
-- Came up with multi-module version number concept for taking advantage of the meta information embedded inside the jars/wars

- KS is disappointed with how WUSH / Subversion is interacting with EC2 and local checkouts

- Created extremely simple command line routines for using java to encrypt/decrypt text and files
- Can now very easily encrypt/decrypt text and files using either bash or java from the command line
-- This will speed things up tremendously going forward, as there are numerous items that need to be able to be encrypted via both techniques

- OLE - Troubleshooting with Peri on how to work in utf8mb4 instead of utf8
-- He's using the replacer-maven-plugin to switch things out
-- Consulting / advice on how to setup their logging

- KC - troubleshooting with Travis on Maven setup
     - generated-sources vs generated-resources related to BIRT and XML beans
