Monday
------
- Continued work on bringing up the new CI
- split the installjenkins script into 2 scripts
-- installjenkins and configurejenkins
-- installjenkins just creates and verifies a vanilla Jenkins instance with a set of plugins (no Kuali specific config)
-- configurejenkins updates the vanilla jenkins with Kuali specific config (secret keys, security settings, jobs, config history, etc)
-- documented improved method for obtaining Oracle JDK's
-- coordinated with Martin on CI related tasks, bringing jobs from ci.rice.kuali.org over to ci.kuali.org

- responded to Peri related to an OLE JIRA about UTF-8

- created automated routine to post M2 repository cache to S3 on demand
- reconfigured the tomcat7 user so it has sudo privileges without requiring a password
- responded to email from Amazon claiming that the Rice secret key is publicly available in Mike O'Clereigh's github account
- the secret key is encrypted, it's not publicly available

Tuesday
-------
- Continued work on bringing up the new CI
-- tested that a KS deploy works correctly 
-- confirms SSH keys are setup correctly + a bunch of other things

- responded to a bogus email from Amazon claiming Rice's secret key was publicly exposed
-- emailed and texted Lue Ann from Amazon related to the bogus email, waiting to hear back


- OLE MySQL utf8 vs utf8mb4
-- analyzed maven-impex-plugin
-- analyzed velocity templates
-- batted around potential ideas/solutions/etc for making the character set and collation configurable via a property

- combined Kuali call (OLE, KS, Rice, OLE, KPME)
- weekly meeting with Jessica

- consulting/empathizing with KC on some craziness Travis found with a BIRT library they depend on
-- BIRT physically embeds a handful of other OSS projects inside of its own jar
-- this causes ridiculous, non-deterministic issues at runtime since there are now 2 different versions of the same class on the classpath
-- provided assurance that DevOps can very quickly/easily publish an updated jar file both to Maven Central and internally
-- where the source code lives eg Subversion / GitHub is irrelevant to that process 

-- left several detailed code reviews on the fusion-maven-plugin KS is developing highlighting a few ways to simplify/improve things

-- Simulated disaster recovery by auto-migrating Kuali's new CI service back and forth between all 3 US regions (us-east-1, us-west-1, us-west-2)
-- Takes ~20 minutes to fully migrate the service to another region with all jobs and build history kept intact
