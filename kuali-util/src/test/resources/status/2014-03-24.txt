Monday
-----
-- consulting with Travis on KC project structure for s2s
-- s2s is a "bridge" between KC proper and grants.gov + research.gov
--- they release "forms" with updated data structures that KC needs to then support
--- the release schedule for the "forms" is not connected to the release schedule for KC in any way
--- Small amount of code that bridges the "forms" data structures into something KC can understand
--- discussion centered around an S2S api + impl module vs just one module with everything
-- Multi-module builds are directly supported (and encouraged) by DevOps
-- Top level aggregator pom that inherits from the Kuali pom, is the usual way of managing complex project structures

-- Mobility 
-- conducted release RC2 from the 3.0.0 branch
-- tweaked the Mobility pom to prevent the release plugin from getting confused (removed the project.scm.url property)

-- Replied in Rice chat correcting a mis-perception about env12 (Dan S. thought it had a 1gb heap, but it's had a 2gb heap for almost a year)

-- Met with infrastructure on getting CI + CAS communicating more effectively
--- Share email + group membership from KIS -> CAS -> CI

-- Met with Larry to discuss next steps with Jenkins
--- Verbally summarized the vast number of improvements that went in
--- established basic time frame for rolling from test -> production

--- Farooq improved CAS to supply the email attribute, testing with Mike
--- SAML 1.1 instead of CAS 2.0 for the protocol

Tuesday
-------
-- Troubleshooting on a KS issue where an overnight build failed due to an open connection to env3
-- No resolution, but KS techs suspect an unclean tomcat shutdown might be resulting in connections being held open even after tomcat shuts down

-- coordinated with Mike on finishing up group based user management for CAS + Jenkins
-- group membership attribute is being passed, but there is a CSV issue, ie the text "ks.dev,rice.dev" gets interpreted as "ks.dev,rice.dev" instead 
   of 2 separate groups
-- not going to pursue email synchronization between CAS and CI for now, in deference to getting KS core tech team up and running on the new CI

-- continued work on caching maven.kuali.org/external and maven.kuali.org/release onto the nightly build slave AMI
