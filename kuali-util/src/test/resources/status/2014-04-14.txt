Monday
------
- Fixed jenkins job issue with environments page not getting updated correctly
- Continued work on bringing KS over to new CI setup
-- OpenSSL + AES encryption instead of GPG
-- Java and bash can now both share encrypted strings with each other
-- Tweak testci config to use AES_PASSPHRASE instead of GPG_PASSPHRASE
-- Fix minor issues with tomcat install routine

-- Spin up Jenkins using -Dec2.stack=prod in all 3 US regions (east, west1, west2)
-- Co-ordinate with Mike on plan for bringing KS over
--- Develop more advanced dashboards/views etc on testci
--- Let this bake in overnight for a few nights
--- Once that works comfortably, spin up ci.kuali.org and migrate things to that
--- Fixed devops bug related to "prod" instance getting spun up but pointing to test-cas
--- An issue still remains with the CAS SSO login not redirecting back to ci.kuali.org correctly

- Minor amount of feedback on Rice 2.4 plans and KS
- HUGE success story here. 
-- DevOps has succeeded in creating an environment @ Kuali that makes it drop dead simple, easy, safe, and reliable for KS to consume Rice builds/releases

- Released kuali-sql for OLE
-- 2 patches related to utf8mb4 vs utf8
-- Had to shorten a Liquibase table column from VARCHAR(255) to VARCHAR(191) so MySQL 5.5+ with utf8mb4 would be able to use it as a primary key
-- Changed Liquibase SQL so it honored the ${mysql.charcterSet} and ${mysql.collate} properties instead of being hard coded to utf8 

Tuesday
-------

- Troubleshooting CAS issue
-- Mike fixed it!
-- Very simple issue with the trailing slash being left off the CAS url
-- Configure CAS and test CAS so ci.kuali.org and testci.kuali.org can use either one to authenticate against

- Dropped another Accunetix file onto demo.rice.kuali.org for Eric W.
