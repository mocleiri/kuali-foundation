Monday
------

- Continued putting finishing touches on ci.kuali.org
- Coordinated with Kristina/Peter on triage for a release issue related to Rice 2.4.0
-- Nobody involved with the release process (QA, Dev, DevOp's etc) had the explicit responsibility of verifying the version # in the pom prior to the release occuring
-- Because of that, 2 releases happened (2.4.0-M5 followed immediately thereafter by a 2.4.0)
-- During the process of shortening the version number from 2.4.0-M5 to 2.4.0, another inadvertent change was introduced to the Rice pom 
-- The version of the parent pom was pre-maturely upgraded from 3.3.44 to 3.4.4 (which should not have happened)
-- Rice Dev now has the explicit responsibility of verifying that the version number in the pom is correct
-- Since the release process finished ok, environments came up ok, builds, unit tests, and integration tests run ok, the impact of the 
-- inadvertent change was determined to be contained to developers spinning up the app inside of an IDE

- Upgraded demo.rice.kuali.org to 2.4.0

- SVN checkout issues for some important KS people
-- Seems to be isolated around geographic boundaries
-- Folks in Toronto have no issues
-- Folks in Phoenix have no issues
-- Folks at UMD and few other spots have horrendous issues (consistently takes more than an hour to checkout the project, should take 3-4 minutes)

Rice
- While troubleshooting an "environment issue" tracked things back to a Java source file that had been deleted during a merge.
- There needs to be a baseline set of Subversion skills people need if they are going to be taking these kind of actions on the Rice code base.
- There is no reason for this kind of issue to keep happening over and over again.  
- The tooling (when used correctly) will protect Rice from this kind of issue 100% of the time without exception.
