Monday
------

- Continued work on bringing up testci
- Quite a bit of back and forth with Mike Wyers related to KS AFT's
- Confirmed Ruby setup was going to work ok
- Got consensus on adding a command line switch to the Ruby code that controls which version of Firefox gets used
- 3 different versions of firefox installed now, only thing that works is 2 threads hitting firefox14 (just like ci.rice)
- 4 threads and/or a different version of firefox, kinda/sorta works, but produces different results than ci.rice
- modified some code posted to stackoverflow related to using curl for interacting with S3
- now have an exceedingly simple, high speed, method for uploading files from an EC2 instance to S3 
- (only had non-authenticated download before this)

Tuesday
-------
- continued work on improving testci setup/configuration/flexibility
- added logic to extract and automatically sync a backup of all configuration (including config-history and build history) to S3 each night
- the size of that backup is too large to continue checking into Subversion like what is being done for the seed configuration
- enhanced scripting to allow authenticated download of resources from S3 so large files no longer have to be encrypted with GPG when being uploaded in order to protect them
- saves time both ways (upload and download)
- meeting with Jessica
