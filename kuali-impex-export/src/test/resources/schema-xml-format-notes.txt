General Schema Format Notes

- Should REALLY shorten all the KS groupId's across the board to just "org.kuali.student"
-- "org.kuali.student" is globally unique, don't need extra qualifiers beyond that at the groupId level
-- Make any/all directory structures under src/main/resources reflect the shortened groupId
- Just keep all schema info in a single file.  eg org/kuali/student/ks-impex-rice-db/schema.xml
- Don't split things up into schema.xml and schema-constraints.xml 
- Make the parsing, and SQL generation routines smart enough to extract from the single XML file whatever it is they need
 
- Sequence's get written to the top of the file, can we change it so tables are first?
- <column> tag, repeats the tableName over and over again for every column.  Since the <column> tag is already nested inside a <table> tag, why repeat the table name?
- <column> tag, can we shorten the "columnDataType" attribute to just "type" or at least "dataType"
- <defaultValue> tag looks like it has an automatically generated linefeed + other whitespace, what's up with that?


- What about a format like this:

<schema>
  <tables>
    <table>
      <columns>
        <column></column>
      </columns>
      <indexes>
        <index></index>
      </indexes>
      <uniqueConstraints>
        <uniqueConstraint></uniqueConstraint>
      </uniqueConstraints>
    </table>
  </tables>
  <foreignKeys>
    <foreignKey></foreignKey>
  </foreignKeys>
  <sequences>
    <sequence></sequence>
  </sequences>
  <views>
    <view></view>
  </views>
</schema>

- What is the difference between <indices unique="true"> and <uniqueConstraint>
- <typeSize scaleSet="false" size="36"/>
- Validation checking or at least logged warnings if indexes, constraints, primary keys, fields, table names, etc don't follow conventions 

KS Specific Notes

- The KSST_RCTYP_JN_RCFLDTYP table has a unique constraint named "IX1", should be "KSST_RCTYP_JN_RCFLDTYP_U1"
