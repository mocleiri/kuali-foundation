# These 4 properties are necessary at the moment because they are used to filter property values from the kuali-sql project
#
# The kuali-sql project is a plain text only project, no dependencies, and no code.
# 
# If kuali-sql changes to the point where it depends on kuali-util then these properties could go away in favor of 
# more sophisticated configuration techniques. eg Spring annotated java config
# 
#

# Make the password the same as the username, by default
jdbc.password=${jdbc.username}

# Make the SQL properties match the JDBC properties, by default
sql.schema=${jdbc.username}
sql.username=${jdbc.username}
sql.password=${jdbc.password}
