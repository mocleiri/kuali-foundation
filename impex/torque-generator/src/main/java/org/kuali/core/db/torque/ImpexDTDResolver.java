/**
 * Kuali customized Torque's database.dtd by adding sequence and view. Thus we
 * need to use our custom dtd instead of the latest one from Torque. At the
 * moment the Kuali database.dtd is stored in many different spots inside
 * Subversion. This is because Impex was not set up such that XML
 * parsing/generation was able to read Kuali's customized database.dtd off of
 * the classpath. Thus, database.dtd has to be present on the file system in the
 * same directory as any schema.xml files that are being parsed.
 * 
 * This class allows a single copy of database.dtd to be bundled into a .jar and
 * shared by everyone at Kuali.
