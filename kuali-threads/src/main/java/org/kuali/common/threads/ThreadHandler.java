/**
 * Handles the execution of threads. The executeThreads() will start all threads and then block until they have
 * completed. If an exception occurs in a client thread the uncaughtException() method of this ThreadHandler will be
 * invoked. The default behavior if that happens is to set the stopThreads flag to true and retain a handle to the
 * exception. Client threads should examine the isStopThreads() method of their handler and shutdown as quickly as
 * possible if that method returns true.
 *
 * The default behavior if an exception occurs in a client thread is for the handler to re-throw it once client threads
 * have completed. If that is not desired, set the rethrowException flag to false. The getException() method can still
 * be used to obtain the exception thrown in the client thread.
