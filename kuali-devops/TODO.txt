- delete old AMI's and snapshots, terminate the build slave
- pre-cache binaries
- automatically update jenkins with new AMI id
- install and pin firefox to a specific version(?)
- improve EC2Service so the amount of time createSnapshot/createAMI will wait is configurable instead of being hardcoded to 1 hour
- release new version of spring-maven-plugin with logging toned down so Maven 3.2 builds don't clutter the console with a bunch of noise
